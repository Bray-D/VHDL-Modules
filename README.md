# VHDL Modules
This repo contains all of my custom made VHDL modules. Many of these modules were created to learn and test my VHDL skills.

If you read this, thank you for looking at my projects. They may be niche but let me learn and sharpen my software or electrical skills.

# Purpose
This repo contains VHDL modules/entities. They range from simple items like an basic flip flops to more complex like an adder-subtractor. My plan is
to eventually build a small CPU or ALU in VHDL. I am using VHDL instead of Verilog as I have past experience with VHDL. If need be, I will
remake this library in Verilog.

# Implementation
I created these modules uing Vivado WebPack (the free version) and Visual Studio Code. As far as I am aware, no specific VHDL simulator is
required to run these modules.
